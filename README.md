## Installation

Using the inproperly syntaxed code I looked for redundancies withing the CSS and HTML. After cleaning up the CSS I moved onto the HTML. The code had little to no specificaions instead used broad designations such as div. I corrected these by using proper HTML semantic elements. 

## Usage
